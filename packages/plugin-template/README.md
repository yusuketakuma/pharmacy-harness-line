# LINE Harness Plugin Template

A template for building integrations that connect external services to LINE Harness.

Use this as a starting point when building a plugin for services like MedicalForce, HotPepper, Shopify, or any other platform.

## What This Template Includes

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/index.ts` | CF Worker entry point with cron + webhook handlers |
| `src/sync.ts` | Sync external data to LINE Harness (tags, metadata) |
| `src/notify.ts` | Send LINE messages based on external conditions |
| `src/external-api.ts` | External API client stub |
| `mcp-server/index.ts` | MCP server for AI agent integration |
| `mcp-server/tools/example-tool.ts` | Example MCP tools combining external API + LINE Harness |

## Getting Started

1. **Copy this template** into a new directory:

```bash
cp -r packages/plugin-template packages/plugin-yourservice
```

2. **Rename** all occurrences of `MyService` / `myservice` to your service name.

3. **Implement the external API client** in `src/external-api.ts` — replace the stub with real API calls.

4. **Customize sync logic** in `src/sync.ts` — define which data maps to LINE Harness tags and metadata.

5. **Customize notifications** in `src/notify.ts` — define when and what messages to send.

6. **Install dependencies**:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `LINE_HARNESS_API_URL` | Your LINE Harness API base URL |
| `LINE_HARNESS_API_KEY` | API key for LINE Harness (set as secret) |
| `LINE_HARNESS_TENANT_ID` | Required LINE Harness tenant ID |
| `EXTERNAL_API_KEY` | API key for the external service (set as secret) |
| `LINE_ACCOUNT_ID` | (Optional) LINE account ID for multi-account setups |

### Setting Secrets

```bash
wrangler secret put LINE_HARNESS_API_KEY
wrangler secret put EXTERNAL_API_KEY
```

### Cron Schedule

Edit `wrangler.toml` to change the sync frequency:

```toml
[triggers]
crons = ["0 * * * *"]    # every hour
# crons = ["*/15 * * * *"]  # every 15 minutes
# crons = ["0 9 * * *"]     # daily at 9:00 UTC
```

## Deploying the Worker

```bash
# Development
pnpm dev

# Production
pnpm deploy
```

### Recovering Notification Setup

Notification scenarios are created inactive, populated with a message step, and
then activated. Trigger tags are attached only after setup succeeds. If setup
fails, the next run leaves the incomplete scenario unchanged and stops before
attaching notification tags. It also stops for a paused scenario or a mismatched
trigger, rather than reactivating or rewriting it.

Review the scenario in the admin UI, confirm its trigger tag and message steps,
and activate it when ready. A later cron run can then resume. Existing message
steps are preserved; notification tags already attached to friends are not reset.

## MCP Server Setup

The MCP server lets AI agents (Claude, etc.) interact with your plugin via natural language.

### Build

```bash
pnpm build:mcp
```

### Register in `.mcp.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "myservice": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["packages/plugin-yourservice/dist-mcp/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "LINE_HARNESS_API_URL": "https://your-line-harness.example.com",
        "LINE_HARNESS_API_KEY": "your-api-key",
        "LINE_HARNESS_TENANT_ID": "your-tenant-id",
        "EXTERNAL_API_KEY": "your-external-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Available MCP Tools

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `lookup_customer` | Look up a customer in MyService and show their LINE profile |
| `send_myservice_notification` | Send a notification to a LINE friend |

Add more tools by creating files in `mcp-server/tools/` and registering them in `mcp-server/index.ts`.

## Architecture

```
External Service (MyService)
    │
    ├── Cron sync ──→ LINE Harness API (tags, metadata)
    ├── Webhooks ───→ CF Worker → LINE Harness API (messages)
    └── MCP tools ──→ AI Agent → LINE Harness SDK
```

The plugin acts as a bridge: it reads data from the external service and writes to LINE Harness via the SDK. It never touches LINE's Messaging API directly — that is handled by LINE Harness.

## Adding New MCP Tools

1. Create a new file in `mcp-server/tools/`:

```typescript
import type { McpServer } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js'
import { z } from 'zod'

export function registerMyTool(server: McpServer): void {
  server.tool(
    'my_tool_name',
    'Description of what this tool does',
    {
      param1: z.string().describe('Parameter description'),
    },
    async ({ param1 }) => {
      // Your implementation here
      return {
        content: [{ type: 'text', text: JSON.stringify({ result: param1 }) }],
      }
    },
  )
}
```

2. Register it in `mcp-server/index.ts`:

```typescript
import { registerMyTool } from './tools/my-tool.js'
registerMyTool(server)
```
