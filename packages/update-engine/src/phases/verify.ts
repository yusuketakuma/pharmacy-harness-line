 * Phase 2 — Verify.
 *
 * Runs post-deploy health probes to confirm the new Worker, schema, admin
 * UI and LIFF UI are all reachable before declaring the update successful.
 *
 * Order is deliberate so a failure points at the most likely culprit:
 *   1. Worker `/health` — proves the new Worker booted and responds.
 *   2. D1 `SELECT 1` — proves the Worker (and our token) can still talk
 *      to the database after migrations. Using `executeD1Query` directly
 *      keeps the assertion close to what the Worker itself would do.
 *   3. Admin Pages — confirms the admin bundle is being served.
 *   4. LIFF Pages — confirms the customer-facing bundle is being served.
 *
 * Each HTTP probe (1, 3, 4) retries up to 3 times with a 3s delay between
 * attempts to absorb the propagation lag Cloudflare's edge sometimes
 * exhibits right after a deploy. D1 does NOT retry here — the orchestrator
 * will retry the whole phase if it has to, and a transient D1 error is
 * rare enough that adding two more failed queries would just add noise.
 *
 * The `running` event is emitted up front; `done` is ONLY emitted on full
 * success. Any failure re-throws and the orchestrator owns the `failed`
 * event + rollback policy. We intentionally do not catch + emit here so
 * the error message naming the failing URL surfaces unmodified upstream.
