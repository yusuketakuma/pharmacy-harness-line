 * Phase 1 — Apply.
 *
 * Runs the four sub-steps of an update in strict order:
 *
 *   1. Migrations — apply each SQL file from the bundle to D1, one at a
 *      time. Migrations are additive by convention (new tables/columns
 *      only) so existing Workers keep functioning until the new Worker
 *      is uploaded in step 2.
 *   2. Worker — read existing bindings (CF does NOT preserve them across
 *      script uploads) and re-PUT the new script with the same bindings
 *      attached. By this point the schema already supports the new code.
 *   3. Admin Pages — deploy the admin UI bundle. Goes after the Worker so
 *      the admin UI's API calls hit the new Worker, not the old one.
 *   4. LIFF Pages — deploy the customer-facing LIFF UI last for the same
 *      reason.
 *
 * Every step emits `{ status: 'running' }` before the side effect and
 * `{ status: 'done' }` afterward. On any failure the error is re-thrown
 * untouched — the orchestrator is responsible for emitting a `failed`
 * event and kicking off rollback. We intentionally do NOT catch + emit
 * here so retry/rollback policy stays in one place upstream.
